# MLX90640.py-
A simple python driver for the MLX90640 loosely based on the original c++ driver from Melexis.

I wrote the driver for a school project with the raspberry Pi and did not implement everything, it is similar to the c++ driver. It uses smbus2  as i2c bus library but i think it is relatively easy to modify it to work with other librarys too.
